Scraping Communicable Disease Reporting Requirements and Packaging in an API

To build and use the API, you need to add the following into the root directory:

MRCONSO.RRF
the "public_mm" directory of Metamap 2020

Then run "docker-compose up --build" to build and run the server.

This work is to be presented at AMIA CIC 2023. If you find it useful, please cite us:
